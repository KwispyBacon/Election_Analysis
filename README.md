# Election_Analysis
## How I Found the Data
I started with setting variables for the total votes, candidate options/votes, the county list/votes.
## Variable Creation/Candidate TrackingVariable 
With the variable I set, I tracked the winning cadidate, the vote count of that candidate and the percentage of votes accounted for that candidate. To get this data I used for loops to find the and count the votes for each candidate with the possibility of another candidate not already set in the election using an "if" conditional statement. After setting the conditional for any abnormal candidate name I then added an "if" conditional for the county list as well counting any county name that was not already put on the list.
## County Tracking
After finding the winning candidate I tracked the largest county by tracking how many votes each county had. I did this using for loops with the dictionary I had created to track the votes for each county. 

Concluding the code the election results come to a total vote count of 369,711
